# Form Validation System
### Designed and implemented a Form Validation System using PHP, HTML, and CSS to ensure user input validation and data security.
**Features Implemented**:  
* Input fields for user details (e.g., name, email, password, and phone number).  
* Client-side validation using **HTML5** attributes and **CSS** for UI enhancements.  
* Server-side validation using **PHP** to check for empty fields, valid email format, password strength, and other security measures.  
* Error messages displayed dynamically to guide users in correcting invalid input.  
* Prevented SQL injection and XSS attacks by sanitizing user inputs.
